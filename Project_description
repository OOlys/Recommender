<h1> Neighborood recommender</h1>

<h2>Business problem</h2>

When you rent a place for vacations, or for an internship, in another city that you don't know, it can be difficult to choose a neighborood. 
Some neighborood are quiet with parks, others have a lot of restaurants...

The aim of this recommender is to provide a list of neighborood similar to a neighborood that you like, in targeted cities.

You enter a neighborood in a city that you know and like, the name of the targeted city, and the recommender will provide to you neighborood 
similar to the one that you enjoy in the targeted cities. It could help people to choose a place for vacations or living when they don't have 
the possibility to visit the targeted city before (for example, interns, students in international exchanges...).

<h2> Data </h2>

For the scope of this projects, I will start with three cities: Paris, New York and Singapore.

For Paris, I will generate the districts numbers. For Singapore and New York, I will use data from wikipedia:
Singapore:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_codes_in_Singapore
New York: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_des_quartiers_de_New_York

I will then use these names to localize each neighborood using geolocator.

In order to assign features to each district, I will use the foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/) in order 
to retrieve the places and their features for each neighborood. Foursquare provide venues (restaurants, parks, yoga studios etc... within a 
determined radius around a point.

I will then cluster neighboroods. The recommender will provide a list of neighboroods with the same cluster than the initial neighborood, 
but in the targeted city. This list will help people to choose a neighborood similar to the one they love, but in another city that they don't know.
